# communityKitchen
Authors Patrick Luong, Chisiom Ehirim, Fauzia Ameeri

This is a final project for full stack software development class. It is a kitchen that incorporates several cultures and backgrounds. The Community kitchen is a place where immigrants from various cultures come together to showcase their culture through the various dishes they prepare and sell to the public as a means to raise fund for other pet projects. This project was put together by Patrick, Chisom, and Fauzia. Through this project, we are able to demonstrate the beauty in diversity and it offers everyone of us and the visitors on our website the opportunity to learn about other cultures. Let's dive in...

There are two classes, a Country Cuisine and a Food class that is a child of the former.

We implemented the class using a suggestion form

in our kitchen.



All functions are routed through fat-fee using a controller.
